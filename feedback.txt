Sergo and Ilona: Congrats for making an amazing project to your first Hackathon! 
The code is working and I can see the effort you've put on it. Good job!
Here are my comments to your improvement:
The code seems slightly disorganized:I noticed a password generator within the hackathon repo 
that doesn't appear to be connected to the project and should have been removed. 
It would be beneficial to specify in the README file which file needs to be run to initiate the program. 
The 'main.py' file should always be the one that runs the program, so I suggest you rename 'menu.py' to 'main.py' and find a new name for the existing 'main.py' file.
